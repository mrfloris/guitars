# 🎸 Guitars

Welcome to my guitar collection repo! My name is Floris, and this is where I document my passion for guitars. And Especially the unique journey of my Gibson Custom Shop ES-335. This project is both a personal archive and a space to explore specs, terminology, and stories. If you’re a fellow lefty, collector, or just curious, feel free to look around or say hi on my discord.gg/floris in #art-hobbies

## 🎼 Why This Repo?

Guitars are more than just wood and strings: they have stories, they are very personal. I wanted a place to preserve the details and history of the instruments I own (and maybe a few more in the future, who knows). It’s also a fun excuse to nerd out about specs and connect with others who care about this stuff.

## 📚 Collection
I have a few guitars, I mean it, I promise I won't buy more. Maybe one more. And no, I haven't collected guitars in the last 30+ years. But, I might start now.

### ⭐ Featured Project
- [Gibson Custom Shop ES-335 (2024 Lefty, Cinnamon Burst)](collections/gibson-es335.md)  
  _This is my main focus—expect frequent updates, specs, and photos!_

  ### 🎸 The Rest of the Collection
- [Epiphone Les Paul](collections/epiphone-lespaul.md)
- [Ibanez Acoustic](collections/ibanez-acoustic.md)
- [Lindo Koya (Japanese Art Finish)](collections/lindo-koya.md)

_(More to come? Maybe a Furch, Martin, or another Les Paul… Stay tuned!)_

## 👈 Lefty Life

Yep, I’m left-handed. Tried to play righty, but it just never clicked. Switching to a left-handed guitar made all the difference and helped me learn much faster. If you’re a lefty struggling with guitar, trust me—you’re not alone!

## 📷 Photos

Each guitar has its own folder in `/photos/`, named after the guitar’s model (e.g., `/photos/gibson-es335/`).  
Each collection file contains a "Photos" section showing and linking to its images.

**Temporary folder structure:**
I am still thinking about adding photos, might remove this later

## 💔 Guitars Broken

Guitars that sadly broke, got damaged, or became unplayable:
- Stratocaster (travel accident)
- Some Acoustic one (caused by cat)
I kept them around for years, eventually decided to throw them out. Life lesson learned: Never listen to others, always keep your guitars.
