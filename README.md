# ðŸŽ¸ Guitars

Welcome to my guitar collection repo! My name is Floris, and this is where I document my passion for guitars. And Especially the unique journey of my Gibson Custom Shop ES-335. This project is both a personal archive and a space to explore specs, terminology, and stories. If youâ€™re a fellow lefty, collector, or just curious, feel free to look around or say hi on my discord.gg/floris in #art-hobbies

## ðŸŽ¼ Why This Repo?

Guitars are more than just wood and strings: they have stories, they are very personal. I wanted a place to preserve the details and history of the instruments I own (and maybe a few more in the future, who knows). Itâ€™s also a fun excuse to nerd out about specs and connect with others who care about this stuff.

## Collection
I have a few guitars, I mean it, I promise I won't buy more. Maybe one more. And no, I haven't collected guitars in the last 30+ years. But, I might start now.

What I have however, is my existing collection, and I recently added a couple more to it. Including a Gibson Custom Shop ES-335 and a Lindo Guitar with a Japoanese art finish. What's next Furch? Martin? Another Les Paul? We will see.

## Lefty
Yes, I am left handed. I hate it. I tried playing right handed and it didn't feel natural. Once we made a guitar left handed it just felt right, and I learned to play guitar a lot quicker.
