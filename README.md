My hobby! Guitars. And I want to keep track of the history of the es335 that I recently got. It's a unique guitar and I want to store its details for reference. It's a way to preserve the history of its journey as well as an opportunity for me to learn more about all the terminology and features. 

## Collection
I have a few guitars, I mean it, I promise I won't buy more. Maybe one more. And no, I haven't collected guitars in the last 30+ years. But, I might start now.

What I have however, is my existing collection, and I recently added a couple more to it. Including a Gibson Custom Shop ES-335 and a Lindo Guitar with a Japoanese art finish. What's next Furch? Martin? Another Les Paul? We will see.

## Lefty
Yes, I am left handed. I hate it. I tried playing right handed and it didn't feel natural. Once we made a guitar left handed it just felt right, and I learned to play guitar a lot quicker.
