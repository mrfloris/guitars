# Ibanez Guitars

My niece showed me a right-handed acoustic. I said: Wait, they have a left-handed one? And within a week I played it and bought it. It's my daily driver.

## Ibanez Acoustic

Semi-acoustic, with cut-away. It's pretty great. It has a balanced tone that lets me play soft on this type of string, and I love holding it and playing on it to learn new songs while watching tv :D
