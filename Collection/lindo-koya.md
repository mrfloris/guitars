# Lindo Guitars

A guitar with Japanese art, what! This is so different to what I would normally play on, so I had to get it.

## Koya electric

Finish is art, the guitar is economical, it's a new approach to guitar making, and I love it. It's not the same high end quality - of course - but, it plays really nice, and has its own purpose. I really enjoy it. It looks great in the apartment. I bought something 'different', something to just grab and play on. Something that is a bit of furniture in the room.
